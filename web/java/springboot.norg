* File upload

When uploading large file, Spring boot will leave the proc file written on disk
while reading in new input. We can use this for arbitrary file upload (assuming
path traversal, can escalate to SSTI etc)

`curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/ --limit-rate 1K -F "files=@payload" -X GET`

then spray `/proc/self/fd/x` for the file.
