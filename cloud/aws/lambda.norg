* Background

  Lambdas are functions that can be ran on demand instead of hosting an entire server for it.

  The credentials for these lambdas are usually found in env vars. Sometimes when an error occurs the lambda will dump
  its env, which leaks your credentials.

  If you have SSRF, you can try `file:///proc/self/environ` to get env.

* List functions

  `aws lambda list-functions`

* Describe function

  `aws lambda get-policy --function-name`
